## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Shadcn UI for component styling
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- WebSocket for real-time communications
- Wouter for routing
- date-fns for timestamp handling

### Backend
- Express.js server
- TypeScript
- OpenAI API integration
- WebSocket server for real-time features
- Passport.js authentication

### Database & ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- Drizzle ORM with Zod validation
- Connection pooling for optimal performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Set up the database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture
- Component-based structure with shared UI components
- Centralized state management using React Query
- Real-time updates via WebSocket integration
- Protected routes with authentication checks

### Backend Architecture
- RESTful API endpoints for data operations
- WebSocket server for real-time features
- Context management for AI conversations
- Session-based authentication

### Data Flow
1. Frontend components make API requests using React Query
2. Backend validates requests and manages business logic
3. Database operations handled through Drizzle ORM
4. Real-time updates propagated via WebSocket connections

### Key Process Flows

#### Circle Sharing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant API as API Server
    participant DB as Database
    participant N as Notification System

    U->>API: POST /api/circles/{id}/share
    Note over U,API: Share request with user IDs
    API->>DB: Check circle ownership
    API->>DB: Verify users exist
    API->>DB: Create share records
    API->>N: Send share notifications
    N-->>U: Push notifications
    API-->>U: 200 OK with share status
```

#### User Invitation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U1 as Inviting User
    participant API as API Server
    participant DB as Database
    participant U2 as Invited User
    participant Email as Email Service

    U1->>API: POST /api/circles/{id}/invite
    Note over U1,API: Invitation with email/username
    API->>DB: Validate circle membership
    API->>DB: Create invitation record
    API->>Email: Send invitation email
    Email-->>U2: Receive invitation
    U2->>API: GET /api/invitations/{token}
    API->>DB: Verify invitation token
    API->>DB: Add user to circle
    API-->>U2: 200 OK + Circle details
```

#### Delayed AI Follower Posting Flow

    B -->|Store Post| C[Database]
    B -->|Queue Response Task| D[Response Scheduler]
    D -->|Check AI Context| E{Context Manager}
    E -->|Get Post History| F[Thread Manager]
