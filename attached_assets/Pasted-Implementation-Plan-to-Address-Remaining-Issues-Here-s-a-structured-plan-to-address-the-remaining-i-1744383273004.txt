Implementation Plan to Address Remaining Issues
Here's a structured plan to address the remaining issues in our API testing implementation:

Phase 1: Fix TypeScript Errors and Type Definitions (Estimated time: 1-2 days)
Create Type Definition Files:

Create a dedicated types file for test-specific interfaces
Define proper interface for storage methods used in tests
Update Storage Interface References:

Examine current storage implementation to understand available methods
Create test-specific mock interfaces that match the actual implementation
Update test files to use the correct method signatures
Add Missing API Implementations:

Identify missing API methods referenced in tests (like hasCirclePermission)
Implement these missing methods or add proper mocks
Phase 2: Configure Jest for TypeScript (Estimated time: 1 day)
Update Jest Configuration:

Modify jest.config.ts to properly handle TypeScript files
Configure preset for TypeScript testing (ts-jest)
Set up proper module path mapping to match the project structure
Add Test Environment Configuration:

Configure environment settings for testing (Node vs jsdom)
Set up test globals for commonly used testing utilities
Add Transform Configuration:

Configure proper transformers for TypeScript files
Set up proper handling for non-TypeScript assets
Phase 3: Create Test-Specific Storage Implementation (Estimated time: 2-3 days)
Analyze Existing Storage Interface:

Examine current storage.ts to understand the interface structure
Document methods and their signatures used in testing
Create Test Storage Module:

Implement a test-specific version of storage that can be easily mocked
Ensure it matches the actual storage interface
Add proper type definitions
Implement Mock Factory:

Create factory functions to generate consistent test data
Implement helper utilities for creating test objects (users, followers, etc.)
Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Estimated time: 1-2 days)
Run Tests in Isolation:

Create a minimal test runner that can run individual test files
Test each component in isolation to identify and fix remaining issues
Integration Testing:

Test the full test suite execution
Verify that all components work together correctly
Documentation Updates:

Update README with any new information
Document any known limitations or workarounds
