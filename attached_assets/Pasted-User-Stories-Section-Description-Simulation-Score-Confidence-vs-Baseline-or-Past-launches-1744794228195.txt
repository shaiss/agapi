User Stories for Product Managers
Objective:
Validate new feature ideas with simulated user behavior before writing code.
Feature Reaction Simulation
As a Product Manager
I want to simulate how a new feature will be received
So that I can decide whether to build it, tweak it, or kill it.
Dashboard needs to show:
Feature Acceptance Score (0–100%)
% of simulated users who engage, ignore, or bounce
Predicted NPS shift
Summary of sentiment + reasons behind negative or positive reactions
Persona segments with different reactions
“Go / Wait / Rethink” recommendation (based on confidence level vs. baseline)

User Story 2: Iteration Planning
As a Product Manager
I want to see how changes to my proposed feature shift user reaction
So that I can optimize before final scoping.
Dashboard needs to show:
Delta comparison between V1 and V2 reactions
Drop-off or increase reasons and moments in user flow
Suggested UX improvements (from agent reasoning)
Timeline estimation of engagement (if feature isn’t compelling long-term)
User Stories for Marketers
Objective:
Test and refine campaign messaging before public launch.
User Story 3: Campaign Resonance Testing
As a Growth Marketer
I want to test my campaign idea
So that I can see how different audience segments react to it.
Dashboard needs to show:
Sentiment breakdown (positive / neutral / negative)
Engagement prediction
Feroz: 
High-Level Metrics:
Impressions
Engagement Percentage
Detailed Engagement Metrics:
Shares
Likes
Quote Tweets
Retweets


Persona-based insights (for example: Gen Z loves the tone, Boomers find it confusing)
Confusion triggers (based on AI questions from agents)
If someone’s confused, they ask questions like:
“Wait, is this free or paid?”
“Why would I need this?”
“Is this feature replacing the old one?”
In Agapi, agents can do the same thing → which will help identify what is unclear from the original post. 
Virality score based on content style, time of day, channel
Agent-triggered ripple effect (who shares it and how far it spreads)
User Stories for Blockchain 
1. Airdrop Simulation
As a blockchain ecosystem lead or dapp owner
I want to simulate how different wallet segments will react to an airdrop
So that I can reduce sell pressure and optimize long-term retention.
Agapi Dashboard Needs to Show:
Wallet behavior segmentation (farmers vs loyal holders)
Predicted sell pressure over time
Retention curves based on distribution method
Comparison of flat vs performance-based drop strategies
Recommended changes (vesting tweak, eligibility filters, claim vs airdrop)
2. Liquidity Allocation Forecasting
As a protocol lead managing ecosystem funds
I want to simulate how allocating liquidity to a specific protocol will affect ecosystem TVL, usage, and stability
So that I can deploy capital intentionally and maximize real outcomes.
Agapi Dashboard Needs to Show:
Simulated feedback from whales, LPs, and retail
Predicted TVL gain/loss per allocation strategy
Risk alerts (centralization of incentives, mercenary capital)
Community sentiment indicators (based on forum/Discord scraping)
Comparison of outcomes over time across scenarios
