Implementation Plan: Enhanced Lab Goals & Metrics Setup
1. Terminology & UI Updates
First Phase:
Update "Audience Persona Analysis" to "Collective Analysis" in the Results tab
Modify all references to "personas" to use "collectives" throughout the UI
Update visual components to match existing collective styling for consistency
2. Template System for Lab Goals & Metrics
Data Structure
interface LabTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: "product" | "marketing" | "content" | "engagement";
  goals: string;
  metrics: {
    name: string;
    target: string;
    priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  }[];
}
Template Selection UI
Add a new section to the "Goals & Description" tab:
Template selection dropdown at the top
Visual cards for each template with preview
"Apply Template" button that populates goals and metrics fields
Backend Storage
Create /api/lab-templates endpoints for CRUD operations
Add predefined templates for common experiment types (product launch, content optimization, etc.)
3. LLM-Assisted Goal & Metric Generation
User Flow
User enters natural language description of their experiment goals
User clicks "Generate Suggested Goals & Metrics" button
System makes LLM API call to parse and structure the input
Generated goals and metrics are displayed with ability to edit/confirm
Technical Implementation
Create a new endpoint: /api/labs/generate-goals
Implementation in server/routes.ts:
app.post('/api/labs/generate-goals', async (req, res) => {
  const { description } = req.body;
  
  try {
    // Make OpenAI API call with structured prompt
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: "You are an expert in experiment design and product analytics."
        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `Based on this experiment description, generate clear goals and measurable metrics: ${description}`
        }
      ],
      response_format: { type: "json_object" }
    });
    
    const generatedContent = JSON.parse(completion.choices[0].message.content);
    res.json(generatedContent);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to generate goals and metrics" });
  }
});
Frontend Integration
Add loading state for the generation process
Display generated content in editable fields
Allow users to accept as-is or modify before saving
4. Metrics Management UI
Enhanced Goals & Description UI
Add ability to add/remove/edit metrics dynamically
Drag-and-drop reordering of metrics (priority adjustment)
Visual indicator of metric importance
Preview of how metrics will appear in Results tab
Metrics Validation
Ensure metrics have clear targets and are measurable
Validate that high-priority metrics are properly defined
Suggest improvements to vague metrics
5. Integration with Results Tab
Dynamic Results Display
Modify the Results tab to dynamically display metrics based on what was defined
Show actual performance against targets for each defined metric
Only display relevant visualization cards based on experiment type and metrics
Data Pipeline
Connect metrics collection to appropriate data sources
Create aggregation pipeline for metric calculations
Add API endpoints for retrieving performance data
6. Implementation Phases
Phase 1: UI Updates & Templates
Update terminology (personas â†’ collectives)
Implement template selection UI
Create predefined templates
Add template application functionality
Phase 2: LLM Integration
Create goal generation endpoint
Add frontend integration for LLM suggestions
Implement loading states and user feedback
Add validation and refinement UI
Phase 3: Results Integration
Update Results tab to use actual metrics from experiment setup
Connect data pipeline for metrics collection
Add visualization components for each metric type
Implement dynamic recommendation system based on performance
7. Technical Considerations
Store template selections and customizations in the lab metadata
Cache LLM-generated suggestions to avoid redundant API calls
Add periodic metrics refresh for active experiments
Implement progressive loading for performance data
